# Quantum_Control
The code used in the task "Exercise 1 - UD. 2", assigned by Prof. Juan Ignacio Mulero in the UIMP QT Master's Program, is designed to numerically simulate a two-level system driven by continuous measurement and subjected to Werner noise. The simulation is performed using the QuTip library in Python.

On the other hand, the code for "Exercise 4 - UD. 2" compares the closed-loop and open-loop dynamics in a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator LQG problem.
