# Quantum_Control
The code used in the task "Exercise 1 - UD. 2" by Prof. Juan Ignacio Mulero in the UIMP QT Master's Program. The code has been designed to simulate numerically a two-level system driven with a continuous measurement subjected to Werner noise. The simulation is carried out using the QuTip library in Python.
